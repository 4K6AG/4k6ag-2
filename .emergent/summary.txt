The previous AI engineer successfully built a full-stack, multi-language web application for a radio station (4K6AG) using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The development followed a structured approach, starting with a mock-data-driven frontend, followed by backend implementation, and then integration. Key architectural decisions included using Shadcn UI for the frontend, a  prefix for all backend routes to align with Kubernetes ingress, and separate services for API calls.

Initially, the AI clarified product requirements with the user, focusing on specific sections, language support (Azerbaijani, Russian, English), and special functionalities like QSL request forms and station status. The frontend was developed iteratively, creating components in batches with mock data, ensuring a functional and visually appealing user experience. After frontend completion and validation via screenshot tool, the backend was developed, including MongoDB models and API endpoints. A crucial step was defining API contracts in .

During backend development, an environment variable  was encountered due to incorrect  loading, which was quickly debugged and fixed. Post-fix, the backend APIs were verified. Frontend-backend integration then commenced, replacing mock data with real API calls. A minor hiccup with a frontend error and user-provided data for station details led to an API update. Finally, comprehensive backend testing (24/24 tests passed) was performed, and the user opted for manual frontend testing, concluding the AI's active development phase.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a modern, multi-language website for a radio station, 4K6AG. The primary goal was to create an online presence with specific information and interactive features.

**Core Requirements:**
*   **Multi-language Support**: The site must dynamically change language based on the user's country, supporting Azerbaijani, Russian, and English. A language switcher in the header is also required.
*   **Main Sections**:
    *   О станции (About Station): Detailed information about the operator and license.
    *   Оборудование (Equipment): Cards displaying technical specifications.
    *   QSL карточки (QSL Cards): A gallery and information on QSL confirmation procedures.
    *   Контакты (Contacts): A contact form and contact information.
    *   Галерея фото (Photo Gallery): Photos of the station and equipment with modal windows.
    *   Достижения/Дипломы (Achievements/Diplomas): Awards and statistics.
    *   Новости (News): Latest updates and station activity.
    *   Техническая информация (Technical Information).
    *   Гостевая книга (Guestbook).
*   **Special Functions**:
    *   Form for QSL requests.
    *   Station status (on-air/off-air) displayed in real-time.
    *   Integration with radio amateur databases.

**Implementation Status**:
A full-stack application has been developed. The frontend is built with React, leveraging Shadcn/UI for components, and is fully integrated with a FastAPI backend backed by MongoDB. Multi-language support, all main sections, and core functionalities like the QSL request form, station status, and image gallery with modals are implemented. All data is now fetched from the backend, replacing initial mock data.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI for modern and accessible React components.
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM for frontend navigation.
-   **API Communication**: Axios for HTTP requests between frontend and backend.
-   **Environment Management**:  for backend,  for frontend variables.
-   **Data Validation**: Pydantic for API request/response models.
-   **CORS**:  for cross-origin requests.
-   **Testing**:  for automated backend API validation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a typical full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/.env**: Crucial for environment variables like  and . Initially caused a  due to incorrect loading, later fixed by ensuring  was called early.
-   **/app/backend/database.py**: Handles MongoDB connection and setup. Modified to correctly load environment variables for MongoDB configuration.
-   **/app/backend/models.py**: Defines Pydantic models for various data entities (e.g., , , , , , , , ). These models are used for request/response validation and database schema.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The main FastAPI application.
    -   Sets up CORS middleware.
    -   Defines a root endpoint () and various API routes prefixed with  for station info, equipment, QSL cards, contacts, news, gallery, achievements, and guestbook, utilizing  for data handling.
    -   Includes a shutdown event for the MongoDB client.
    -   **Changes**: Initial  endpoint, expanded with full CRUD operations for all required features. An error with  access was fixed by ensuring  was placed correctly and  was used.
-   **/app/contracts.md**: A newly created file outlining the API endpoints, request/response structures, and integration details between frontend and backend.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React application entry point.
    -   Sets up  for routing.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained a simple Hello World call. Modified to integrate Header, Hero, and other main components, and to remove mock data for API calls.
-   **/app/frontend/src/mock.js**: Contains mock data used for initial frontend development. This file was created to facilitate rapid frontend prototyping and was subsequently removed or bypassed once backend integration was complete.
-   **/app/frontend/src/services/api.js**: A new file created to centralize all API calls, abstracting the  implementation and using  for backend communication.
-   **/app/frontend/src/hooks/useData.js**: A new custom hook created to fetch and manage data from the API, facilitating integration across components.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/\*.js**: Numerous components were created (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , , ). These components implement the UI for each section, initially using  and later integrating with  and . The  component is key for the multi-language feature.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Loading.js**: A new component for displaying loading states during data fetching.
-   **/app/test_result.md**: Document used to track backend and frontend testing results. It was read and updated before and after backend testing.

<pending_tasks>
-   Automated frontend testing (user chose to test manually).
-   Integration with radio amateur databases (mentioned in requirements but not explicitly implemented yet).
-   Technical Information section implementation (implied by content structure, but specific API/frontend not detailed as explicitly as others).

<current_work>
The application is a fully functional, multi-language website for the 4K6AG radio station. The frontend, built with React and Shadcn/UI, dynamically adapts to Azerbaijani, Russian, and English, with a working language switcher. It comprises all requested sections: Hero (with real-time station status), About, Equipment, QSL Cards (with a request form), Gallery (with modals), Achievements, News, Contacts (with a functional form), and Footer.

The FastAPI backend, connected to MongoDB, provides all the necessary API endpoints for managing station information, equipment details, QSL card data, contact messages, news, gallery items, achievements, and guestbook entries. Data validation and CRUD operations are implemented. The backend was thoroughly tested, passing all 24 tests successfully.

Frontend components now fetch and display real data from the backend, replacing the initial mock data. For instance, the station operator (Ruslan Muradov) and Grid Square (LN40vi) details are updated via the API and correctly rendered on the frontend. The  file documents the API structure, ensuring seamless interaction.
